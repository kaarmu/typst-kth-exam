# KTH Exam Example

This example mimics exams given at KTH Royal Institute of Technology,
specifically of the EECS school. The goal of this project is to promote
[Typst](https://typst.app) and to show how it can be used.

The template can be used by anyone if logotype and affiliations are
replaced appropriately.
